		Hey baby girl :)
	</p>
	<p>
		I know I can't be with you on our first Valentine's Day.
	</p>
	<p>
		If I could be with you, I would snuggle with you. And lose you in cuddles. And shower you with kisses. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But most importantly, I would cradle you in my arms and sing softly to you. &#9829
	</p>
	<p>
		I may not be able to hold you...
	</p>
	<p>
		but I can still sing to you.
